Translate all your WooCommerce products into 27+ languages with only one click.

Supercharge your content with multilingual AI.

Translate posts, pages, and products with one click, powered by Ovesio.

== What this plugin does ==
â€“ Adds Translate buttons under Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags (and WooCommerce products if you use WooCommerce).
â€“ Sends the text to Ovesio for translation / content generation.
â€“ Creates the translated item(s) automatically and links it with the original (via Polylang).
â€“ Keeps a Requests List so you can see what was sent, when, and the status.

== What you need (dependencies) ==
â€“ WordPress 6.3 or newer
â€“ PHP 7.4+ (8.0+ recommended)
â€“ Polylang (free or Pro) â€“ required for languages
â€“ WooCommerce (optional) â€“ only if you want to translate products & product taxonomies
â€“ An Ovesio account + API key

== Install & activate ==

Upload the ovesio folder (extracted from ovesio-vX.X.X.zip) to /wp-content/plugins/, or install it via Plugins <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â†’</span> Add New <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â†’</span> Upload.

Activate it in Plugins.

After activation the plugin creates its own table in the database â€“ nothing you need to do.

== First-time setup ==
(Settings <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â†’</span> Ovesio)

=== API tab ===
â€“ API URL â€“ leave default unless Ovesio told you otherwise.
â€“ API Key â€“ paste the key from your Ovesio dashboard.

Click Save Changes.

=== The Translation Process ===
â€“ Content language â€“ choose the source language (or "System" to use Polylang's default).
â€“ Workflow â€“ pick your Ovesio workflow ID (if you use one).
â€“ Translate to â€“ tick the languages you want to generate.
â€“ Post status â€“ choose if new content should be Publish, Draft, etc.

Click Save Changes again.

== How to use it ==

Go to Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags (or Products if WooCommerce).

Hover an item â€“ you'll see Translate (with flags) and Translate All.

Click a flag to translate into that language, or Translate All to send to every selected language.

That's it. Once Ovesio finishes, the translated item appears automatically.

= Check the status =
â€“ Ovesio <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â†’</span> Requests List shows every request, its status (Pending / Completed), date, and a link to the Ovesio job.

== What the service is and what it is used for ==
This plugin helps you to translate your website content using Ovesio.com services. You can use it to translate pages, posts, taxonomies, categories and WooCommerce products.

== What data is sent and when ==
This plugin only sends data to ovesio.com when you manually trigger a translation by pressing the translate link present in these sections: post/page/taxonomy/category/product.
Your API keys are stored securely in your WordPress database and are never shared with the plugin developer.
The default domain used for sending data is https://api.ovesio.com/v1/ but in some cases ovesio.com can provide you with a different subdomain of the same domain name in order to be used for translation service.
We do not collect sensitive data or personal information.

== Ovesio terms of service and privacy policy ==
Please check Ovesio.com terms and conditions here: https://ovesio.com/information/terms
and the privacy policy here: https://ovesio.com/information/privacy

== Troubleshooting ==
â€“ Nothing happens when I click Translate: Check you are logged in as a user who can edit posts. Make sure the API key is valid.
â€“ Callback not working / 404: Re-save permalinks. Ensure the Security Hash in the URL matches the one in settings.
â€“ Translations go to the wrong status: Change Post status in Translation settings.
â€“ Polylang errors: Confirm Polylang is active and languages are set.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to edit code =
No. Everything is done from the WordPress admin.

= Can I pick which fields are translated? =
The plugin sends title, content, excerpt and handles taxonomies; advanced control may require adjusting the workflow in Ovesio.

= Does it work without Polylang? =
No, Polylang is required to assign languages and link translations.

= WooCommerce support? =
Yes. Products and product categories/tags are supported if WooCommerce is active.

== Support & feedback ==
â€“ Open an issue on GitHub (if you host the code there)
